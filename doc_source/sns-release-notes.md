# Amazon SNS Release Notes<a name="sns-release-notes"></a>

The following table lists Amazon SNS feature releases and improvements\. For changes to the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*, see [Amazon SNS Document History](sns-document-history.md)\.


| Date | Feature Release | 
| --- | --- | 
| November 14, 2019 | A dead\-letter queue is an Amazon SQS queue that an Amazon SNS subscription can target for messages that can't be delivered to subscribers successfully\. Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors or server errors are held in the dead\-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing\.   The Amazon SNS subscription and Amazon SQS queue must be under the same AWS account and Region\. Currently, you can't use an Amazon SQS FIFO queue as a dead\-letter queue for an Amazon SNS subscription\. To use an encrypted Amazon SQS queue as a dead\-letter queue, you must use a custom CMK with a key policy that grants the Amazon SNS service principal access to AWS KMS API actions\. For more information, see [Protecting Amazon SNS Data Using Server\-Side Encryption \(SSE\) and AWS KMS](sns-server-side-encryption.md) in this guide and [Protecting Amazon SQS Data Using Server\-Side Encryption \(SSE\) and AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/) in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*\.
